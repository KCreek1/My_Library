# My_Library 
(under development)
This is intended to be a personal use library for bookworms.  Maybe you have dozens or even hundreds of books.  How do you keep track of them?
What if you could have a searchable library for your books?  Enter the book details including your rating and a summary.
Easy access for when you want to purchase more or are looking for something to read. 
What if you and your friends want to peruse each others library?  Now you can. Maybe even request to borrow a book.
