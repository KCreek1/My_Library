# My Library

## Description

**My Library** is a personal library web app designed for book lovers. Whether you have dozens or hundreds of books, this app allows you to keep track of your collection, wishlist, and reviews from other users. With a user-friendly interface, you can easily manage your books and connect with other readers.

## Features

- **Manage Your Library**: Keep track of books you own and books you wish to own.
- **User Reviews**: See and add reviews for books.
- **Cloud-Hosted Database**: Store your data on a cloud-based service (Heroku PostgreSQL).
- **Flexible Database**: Potential to refactor to use SQLite for local setups.

## Tech Stack

- **Flask**: Chosen for its simplicity and ease of use with Python. Itâ€™s ideal for building web apps quickly and intuitively.
- **SQLAlchemy**: Used for ORM models to interact with the database. Familiarity with SQLAlchemy made it a natural choice for managing database operations.
- **Heroku PostgreSQL**: Provides a cloud-based database, ensuring reliable and scalable hosting without manual maintenance.

## Design Choices

- **Flask**: Flask was chosen because of its simplicity and familiarity with Python, making it easy to set up a functional web app.
- **SQLAlchemy & PostgreSQL**: SQLAlchemy was selected as the ORM due to familiarity from beta testing with web apps using SQLAlchemy. PostgreSQL on Heroku was chosen for its ease of use and cloud-based infrastructure.

While the app is built for Heroku's PostgreSQL database, it could be refactored to run with SQLite for local or smaller-scale use.

## Project Structure

### **Static**:
Contains static files such as `styles.css` and images used throughout the web app.

### **Gitignore**:
Contains files and folders that should not be committed to version control. It includes:

- `.env`: Stores sensitive Heroku database credentials, which are obscured and kept secure.
- `.venv`: Your local virtual environment for Python dependencies.
- `pycache`: Automatically generated by Python during runtime.
- `flask_session`: Stores session data.



### **database.py**:
Configures the database and initializes the tables used by the app.

## Setup Instructions

### **Prerequisites**:
Python 3.x: Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
Heroku Account: If deploying to Heroku, create an account and set up a new app.

## Local Setup:

### **Clone the repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-library.git
```

### **Create a virtual environment**:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv # or replace .venv with your chosen identifier
```

### **Activate venv**:

```
.venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use .venv\Scripts\activate
```

### **Install dependencies**:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### **Create a .env file in the root directory to store your Heroku PostgreSQL credentials (for Heroku deployments)**

//TODO

### To run app:

```flask run
```
The app should now be running at http://localhost:5000.

### **Deploying to Heroku**:
Ensure that your Heroku account is connected to Git and that you've set up your app on Heroku.

Push your app to Heroku following these steps:

```bash

git remote add heroku https://git.heroku.com/your-app-name.git
git push heroku master
```

Once deployed, your app will be accessible via the Heroku URL.
